This is the Von Neumann stability analysis Matlab live script code for multi-step methods. 
Methods used:
1)	FTBS-Fortward in time and backward in space
2)	SSPRK3-L2R1 scheme 
You can find the numerical gain  from the simulation and theortical gain from the report "Von Neumann Stability Analysis for Multi-level Multi-step Methods"
